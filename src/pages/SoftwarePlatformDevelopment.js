                    Every business and organization will often require some kind
                    of software at some point in their existence. Software
                    development is the process of creating software using
                    computer programming. The types of software used by most
                    companies range from general applications that enable better
                    management of key organizational functions, such as human
                    resources, finances and accounts, inventory and stock, and
                    even running projects, to more specialized software items
                    that have a specific purpose, like content management
                    software for use on company websites.
                    <br />
                    Software development is a measured process, therefore any
                    applications and software programs produced as a result of
                    the process will be specifically tailored to the needs and
                    requirements of your business.
